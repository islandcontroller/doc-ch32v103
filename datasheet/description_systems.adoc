==== RISC-V3A core
[.text-justify]
The _RISC-V3A_ is a 32-bit RISC processor core developed and maintained in-house at WCH. It implements the `RV32I` _RISC-V_ base ISA with hardware multiplication and division (`M`), atomic memory access (`A`) and compressed instructions (`C`), as well as vendor-specific extensions. _Machine_ and _User_ privilege levels are supported. Debugging access is provided via a two-wire serial interface.
